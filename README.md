## üìñ Overview  

This repository provides a collection of simple C++ programs designed to practice the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Each example demonstrates how to define classes, create objects, and implement basic methods in C++.  

The exercises cover real-world entities such as cars, students, books, employees, and more.  
They are intended for beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of OOP concepts through small, practical programs.  

 
## üöÄ How to Run Code

In Visual Studio Code (VSC), you can run your code in **3 ways**:

1. **Run Code button**  
   - Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button (triangle) in the top-right corner.  
   - Select **"Run Code"** ‚Üí your code will be compiled and the result printed to the screen.  

2. **Shortcut key**  
   - Use the shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + N` (same effect as the first way).  

3. **Run via Terminal**  
   - **Step 1:** On the toolbar, open **Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal**.  
   - **Step 2:** Compile your code with:
     ```bash
     g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName
     ```
     This command generates an `.exe` file.
   - **Step 3:** Run the program:
     ```bash
     ./fileName
     ```
   - **Note:**  
     - `fileName.cpp` = the name of your C++ file.  
     - `fileName` = the name of the executable (you can choose another name, but usually keep it the same as your source file for clarity).

## üìö What I Learned  

From this assignment, I improved my understanding of:  
1. How to define and use **classes and objects** in C++.
2. Basic OOP concepts such as attributes and methods.
3. Writing and compiling simple C++ programs in Visual Studio Code.
4. Using **Markdown** to create structured documentation.
5. __The role of `this->` pointer in constructors:__  
   - When parameter names are the same as attribute names, `this->` is required to distinguish between them.  
   - Example:  
     ```cpp
     class Car {
     private:
         string brand;
         int year;
     public:
         Car(string brand, int year) {
             this->brand = brand; // use this-> to avoid ambiguity
             this->year = year;
         }
     };
     ```
   - If different parameter names are used, `this->` is optional (e.g., `Car(string b, int y) { brand = b; year = y; }`).
 
6. **Constructors and Getters/Setters in C++:**  
   - Constructors are used to initialize an object with values immediately when it is created.  
     ```cpp
     Book(string t, string au) {
         title = t;
         author = au;
     }
     Book b("Conan", "Gosho Aoyama"); // quick initialization
     ```  
   - If a parameterized constructor is written, the compiler will not automatically generate a default one ‚Üí we must define it manually if needed:  
     ```cpp
     Book() {} // default constructor
     ```  
   - Getters and setters allow accessing and modifying private attributes after the object is created:  
     ```cpp
     b.setTitle("Harry Potter");
     cout << b.getTitle();
     ```  


    
## ü§ñ About the using AI in learning and doing process  

The AI tool I used most frequently is **ChatGPT**. In this assignment, AI mainly supported me in **English writing** rather than coding.  

- **Advantages:**  
  - These exercises are fundamental, so it was straightforward to write the code myself according to each requirement.  
  - I had already practiced using Markdown in a previous semester, which made it easier to format this README file.  

- **Challenges and how I addressed them:**  
  - **Variable naming in English:** sometimes I had no ideas for meaningful names ‚Üí AI provided suggestions.  
  - **English writing in Notes and the README file:**  
    - Sometimes I first wrote in Vietnamese and then asked AI to translate it into English _(applied in Section 3)_.  
    - Other times I drafted the content in English based on my vocabulary and ideas, then asked AI to shorten and refine it _(applied in Section 2)_.  
  - **Markdown formatting:** I outlined the structure I wanted, then asked AI to generate a proper layout _(applied in the introduction section)_.
